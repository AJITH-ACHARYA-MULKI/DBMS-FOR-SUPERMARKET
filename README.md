# DBMS-FOR-SUPERMARKET
Super market is a place where we purchase groceries. It will be a super tough task for the admin or the owner of the super market to keep an account manually of all the products of all the customers Out of stock products need to be checked every now and then for the replenishment. If the owner wants to know the total stock, then manually he has to count every item. In our project super-market, we make admin owner work much easier than it was before by computerizing some of his her task. It even helps to reduce the consumption of time. This project gives all the information about the items available in the market and eventually the item which are out of stock. By using our project, the owner can take over the business more systematically.
