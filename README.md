The sales prson have been recording the customer information in the past and even in the present through their personal manual efforts.
Indeed, it consumes their considerable time and energy that could be utilized in the better productive activities.
Apart from that, with increasing customer is indeed a cumbersome task.
There is a lot of reasons for the introductioin of this project.
In the manual system, there are number of inefficiencies that a salesperson face.
The information retrieval is one the foremost problems.
Its very difficult to gather the overall prformance report of the customer.
Large record books have to be maintained where relevant and irreelvenat information has to be stored which is very untidy and clumsy process.
The project "SUPERMSRKET" is developed with the objective of making the system reliable, easier, fast, and more informative.

Super market is a place where we purchase groceries. It will be a super tough task for the admin or the owner of the super market to keep an account manually of all the products of all the customers Out of stock products need to be checked every now and then for the replenishment. If the owner wants to know the total stock, then manually he has to count every item. In our project super-market, we make admin owner work much easier than it was before by computerizing some of his her task. It even helps to reduce the consumption of time. This project gives all the information about the items available in the market and eventually the item which are out of stock. By using our project, the owner can take over the business more systematically.
